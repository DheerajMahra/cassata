## Installation

## Development

### Using Commitizen for Commits

We use [Commitizen](https://commitizen.github.io/cz-cli/) for structured commits, ensuring adherence to conventional commit standards.

Instead of using

```bash
git commit -m "{mesage}"
```

run the following command:

```bash
npm run git:commit
```

This will prompt you to fill out the necessary information for a structured commit message based on the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification.

## Recommended Extensions

To improve your development experience, we recommend installing the following VS Code extensions:

1. [EditorConfig for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EditorConfig.EditorConfig): Helps maintain consistent coding styles between different editors and IDEs. You can find more information and installation instructions [here](https://editorconfig.org/).

2. [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode): An opinionated code formatter that supports many languages. To ensure a consistent code style, install the Prettier extension for your editor.
